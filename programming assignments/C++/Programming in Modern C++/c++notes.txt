Lec 6
1. Use manifest constant to declare the size of the array.
like: #define MAX 100

Lec 7
1. if void*a is to be typecasted to int the *(int*)a is the correct syntax.
2. sorting in C uses qsort in which size of(data type), compare function using 
using void pointers in needed to be defined explicitly.
## STL
3. maps are not contigous memory location.
so we cannot do do iter+1 as it will movet the another memory location which may not exist.
so we do iter++ which move to the next available memory location available in the maps.

4. in c++ every container is called a data structure.

# pointer to constant data
{
const int n=5;
const int *p= &n;
}
# constant pointer to data
our genral pointer in which the pointer is restricted to point to a single variable.
