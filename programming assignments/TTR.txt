#Things to Remember
1. if we have to eliminate the same values the remmeber to take "XOR".
   >> a^a=0 ; a^0 = a;
2. to count no. of distinct entries in a array just "CFRTEST"(codechef).
3. Time complexity of max() function is O(1).
4. In array of strings characters are accessed as in 2d matrix.
